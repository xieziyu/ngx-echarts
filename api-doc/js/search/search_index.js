For example:\nimport { graphic } from 'echarts/core';\n\nnew graphic.LinearGradient(/* ... */);ECharts Instance\nechartsInstance is exposed (since v1.1.6) in the (chartInit) event, enabling you to directly call functions like: resize(), showLoading(), etc. For example:\n\nhtml:\n\n\ncomponent:\n\nonChartInit(ec) {\n  this.echartsInstance = ec;\n}\n\nresizeChart() {\n  if (this.echartsInstance) {\n    this.echartsInstance.resize();\n  }\n}ECharts Extensions\nImport echarts theme files or other extension files after you have imported echarts core. For example:\nimport * as echarts from 'echarts/core';\n\n/** echarts extensions: */\nimport { Bar3DChart } from 'echarts-gl/charts';\nimport { Grid3DComponent } from 'echarts-gl/components';\nimport 'echarts/theme/macarons.js';\nimport 'echarts/dist/extension/bmap.min.js';Service\nNgxEchartsService has been obsolete since v4.0\nEvents\nAs ECharts supports the 'click', 'dblclick', 'mousedown', 'mouseup', 'mouseover', 'mouseout', and 'globalout' mouse events, our ngx-echarts directive also supports the same mouse events but with an additional chart prefix. For example:\n\nhtml:\n\n\nThe '$event' is same with the 'params' that ECharts dispatches.\n\nIt supports following event outputs:\n\n\n\n@Output\nEvent\n\n\n\n\nchartInit\nEmitted when the chart is initialized\n\n\nchartClick\necharts event: 'click'\n\n\nchartDblClick\necharts event: 'dblclick'\n\n\nchartMouseDown\necharts event: 'mousedown'\n\n\nchartMouseMove\necharts event: 'mousemove'\n\n\nchartMouseUp\necharts event: 'mouseup'\n\n\nchartMouseOver\necharts event: 'mouseover'\n\n\nchartMouseOut\necharts event: 'mouseout'\n\n\nchartGlobalOut\necharts event: 'globalout'\n\n\nchartContextMenu\necharts event: 'contextmenu'\n\n\nchartHighlight\necharts event: 'highlight'\n\n\nchartDownplay\necharts event: 'downplay'\n\n\nchartSelectChanged\necharts event: 'selectchanged'\n\n\nchartLegendSelectChanged\necharts event: 'legendselectchanged'\n\n\nchartLegendSelected\necharts event: 'legendselected'\n\n\nchartLegendUnselected\necharts event: 'legendunselected'\n\n\nchartLegendLegendSelectAll\necharts event: 'legendselectall'\n\n\nchartLegendLegendInverseSelect\necharts event: 'legendinverseselect'\n\n\nchartLegendScroll\necharts event: 'legendscroll'\n\n\nchartDataZoom\necharts event: 'datazoom'\n\n\nchartDataRangeSelected\necharts event: 'datarangeselected'\n\n\nchartGraphRoam\necharts event: 'graphroam'\n\n\nchartGeoRoam\necharts event: 'georoam'\n\n\nchartTreeRoam\necharts event: 'treeroam'\n\n\nchartTimelineChanged\necharts event: 'timelinechanged'\n\n\nchartTimelinePlayChanged\necharts event: 'timelineplaychanged'\n\n\nchartRestore\necharts event: 'restore'\n\n\nchartDataViewChanged\necharts event: 'dataviewchanged'\n\n\nchartMagicTypeChanged\necharts event: 'magictypechanged'\n\n\nchartGeoSelectChanged\necharts event: 'geoselectchanged'\n\n\nchartGeoSelected\necharts event: 'geoselected'\n\n\nchartGeoUnselected\necharts event: 'geounselected'\n\n\nchartAxisAreaSelected\necharts event: 'axisareaselected'\n\n\nchartBrush\necharts event: 'brush'\n\n\nchartBrushEnd\necharts event: 'brushend'\n\n\nchartBrushSelected\necharts event: 'brushselected'\n\n\nchartGlobalCursorTaken\necharts event: 'globalcursortaken'\n\n\nchartRendered\necharts event: 'rendered'\n\n\nchartFinished\necharts event: 'finished'\n\n\n\nYou can refer to the ECharts tutorial: Events and Actions in ECharts for more details of the event params. You can also refer to the demo page for a detailed example.\nCustom Build\nTreeshaking Custom Build\n\nSince version 5.0.1 ECharts supports Treeshaking with NPM.\n\nThe app.modules.ts should look like this:\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\n\nimport { NgxEchartsDirective, provideEchartsCore } from 'ngx-echarts';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// Import the echarts core module, which provides the necessary interfaces for using echarts.\nimport * as echarts from 'echarts/core';\n\n// Import bar charts, all suffixed with Chart\nimport { BarChart } from 'echarts/charts';\n\n// Import the tooltip, title, rectangular coordinate system, dataset and transform components\nimport {\n  TitleComponent,\n  TooltipComponent,\n  GridComponent,\n  DatasetComponent,\n  TransformComponent\n} from 'echarts/components';\n\n// Features like Universal Transition and Label Layout\nimport { LabelLayout, UniversalTransition } from 'echarts/features';\n\n// Import the Canvas renderer\n// Note that including the CanvasRenderer or SVGRenderer is a required step\nimport { CanvasRenderer } from 'echarts/renderers';\n\n// Import the theme\nimport 'echarts/theme/macarons.js';\n\n// Register the required components\necharts.use([\n  BarChart,\n  TitleComponent,\n  TooltipComponent,\n  GridComponent,\n  DatasetComponent,\n  TransformComponent,\n  LabelLayout,\n  UniversalTransition,\n  CanvasRenderer\n]);\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    HttpClientModule,\n    // import standalone directive:\n    NgxEchartsDirective,\n  ],\n  providers: [{\n    // Provide custom builded ECharts core:\n    provideEchartsCore({ echarts })\n  }],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}Legacy Custom Build\n\nPlease refer to ECharts Documentation for more details.\n\nIf you want to produce a custom build of ECharts, prepare a file like custom-echarts.ts:\n// custom-echarts.ts\nexport * from 'echarts/src/echarts';\n\nimport 'echarts/src/chart/line';\nimport 'echarts/src/chart/bar';\n// component examples:\nimport 'echarts/src/component/tooltip';\nimport 'echarts/src/component/title';\nimport 'echarts/src/component/toolbox';And then inject it in your NgxEchartsModule:\nimport { NgxEchartsModule } from 'ngx-echarts';\nimport * as echarts from './custom-echarts';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    NgxEchartsModule.forRoot({\n      echarts,\n    }),\n  ],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}And if you want to use the global echarts object, please import it from lib or src instead:\nimport * as echarts from 'echarts/lib/echarts';If you need to import theme files, remember to change the 'echarts' path to 'echarts/lib/echarts', for example:\n// ... part of echarts/theme/dark.js:\nfunction (root, factory) {\n    if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {\n        // AMD. Register as an anonymous module.\n        define(['exports', 'echarts/lib/echarts'], factory);\n    } else if (typeof exports === 'object' && typeof exports.nodeName !== 'string') {\n        // CommonJS\n        factory(exports, require('echarts/lib/echarts'));\n    } else {\n        // Browser globals\n        factory({}, root.echarts);\n    }\n}Custom Locale\nYou can change the chart locale registering a built-in locale (located in node_modules/echarts/lib/i18n/) or a custom locale object. To register a locale, you will need to change the module that echart is being imported (usually app.module.ts).\nimport {NgxEchartsModule} from \"ngx-echarts\";\nimport * as echarts from 'echarts/core';\nimport langCZ from 'echarts/lib/i18n/langCZ';\n\necharts.registerLocale(\"CZ\", langCZ)\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [NgxEchartsModule.forRoot({echarts})],\n  declarations: [],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})and in your HTML file use:\nDemo\nYou can clone this repo to your working copy and then launch the demo page in your local machine:\nnpm install\nnpm run demo\n\n# or\nyarn install\nyarn demoThe demo page server is listening on: http://localhost:4202\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2025 Xie, Ziyu\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
