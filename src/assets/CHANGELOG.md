## 4.0.0 (2018-08-20)

#### BREAKING CHANGES
+ ES6 import instead of polluting global namespace. [issue #123](https://github.com/xieziyu/ngx-echarts/issues/123)
+ NgxEchartsService is now obsoleted. If you want to use echarts API, please just import it
  ```typescript
  import * as echarts from 'echarts';
  /** or */
  import { graphic, registerMap } from 'echarts';
  ```
+ No need to configure `angular.json` any more. But we still need to configure `tsconfig.json` currently.
+ Import echarts theme files or other extension files in `main.ts`.

#### New
+ [detectEventChanges] Use it to avoid unwanted change detections. Note that, if you set it false, `chartClick` and some other event-emitters become silent.

#### Changes
+ ECharts instance creating is delayed until view initialized
+ [theme] now detect changes at runtime. Note that, when you change theme at runtime, the chart would be destroyed first and then initialized again.

---

## 2.0.1 (2017-12-11)

#### Bugfix
+ Fix issue: No change detection involved in event handler. [#26](https://github.com/xieziyu/ngx-echarts/issues/26), [#28](https://github.com/xieziyu/ngx-echarts/issues/28)

---

## 2.0.0 (2017-12-04)

#### New
+ New Service: `NgxEchartsService` provided. Refer to [API document](https://xieziyu.github.io/ngx-echarts/api-doc/injectables/NgxEchartsService.html) for details

---

## 2.0.0-beta.0 (2017-11-25)

#### New
+ New input: `[merge]`. The value of `[merge]` will be merged into `[options]`. So it's perfect for updating chart data series. Refer to [ECharts documentation](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/api.html#echartsInstance.setOption) for details

+ New input: `[initOpts]`. The value of `[initOpts]` will be used in `echarts.init()`. It may contain `devicePixelRatio`, `renderer`, `width` or `height` properties. Refer to [ECharts documentation](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/api.html#echarts.init) for details

+ New public methods: `setOption(option: any, otps?: any)`

#### BREAKING CHANGES
+ `[dataset]` is deprecated. It's really hard to understand how `[dataset]` works for chart with multiple data series. So I recommend to use `[merge]` input instead. It's more powerful to merge series than to update values only.

+ `AngularEchartsModule` is renamed to `NgxEchartsModule`. I have to say, it's weird to import `AngularEchartsModule` from `ngx-echarts`.

+ `AngularEchartsDirective` is renamed to `NgxEchartsDirective`. Weird too.

#### Changes
+ `ngx-echarts` now has default `400px` height, if you forget to set height for the div.
